This is mainly for code used to scrape some websites continuously or when needed. It contains code to scrape, sometimes process, and make use of the data gained from online repositories or websites.
1. ```scrape_game_codes```
  scrapes 2 websites which contain promotional codes for the game Solo Leveling: Arise. The code adds the codes to a dictionary, and is set to check the codes daily (not added for testing purposes initially). Once new
  codes are found, they are added to the new_game_codes dictioanry, and the user can mark all the codes they have used as used using a provided method/function.
  Just a fun piece of code for gamers rather than having to look at the website daily, this keeps the user updated easily and dynamically.
